# Frogger-Alarm-
 This is the final Project I completed for the Google-sponsered Computer Science Computing Initiative (CSSI) I collaborated with one other team memeber. We used the p5 javascript library to build Frogger Alarm. An alarm that requires the user to pass three levels of the game Frogger before the Alarm turns off. The user is able to choose different songs to be set as an alarm. If you would like to setup and run this project, you can download the repository and opne the index.html file in a web browser.
